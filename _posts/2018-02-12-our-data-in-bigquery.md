Today, with our publication in _Science_, we are releasing fishing effort data for 2012 to 2016. One of the ways we are releasing it is through Google's BigQuery. https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/

If you have not used BigQuery, vist [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) and clikc on `try it free` to get started. You can query up to one terabyte per month for no charge, which is far more than you will need to analyze our fishing effort data. 

The fishing effort
