Welcome to the Global Fishing Watch data blog. This is the site where we are going to be sharing our data and related analyses from Global Fishing Watch. 

This site is geared toward researchers, software engineers, data scientists, or anyone who is interested in getting access "under the hood" of Global Fishing Watch. 

One of our goals is to be as transparent as possible, and release as much of our data as we can. As a result, not all of our work on this page will be one hundred percent polished. We encourage you to provide feedback and provide suggestions. If you have comments, you can enter them below, or send an email to research@globalfishingwatc.org.
