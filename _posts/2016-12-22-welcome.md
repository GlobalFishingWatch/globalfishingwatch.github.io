Welcome to the Global Fishing Watch data blog. This blog and website are where we will be sharing our data and related analyses from Global Fishing Watch. 

This site is geared toward researchers, software engineers, data scientists, or anyone who is interested in getting access "under the hood" of Global Fishing Watch. For general information about Global Fishing Watch, or to access our interactive map, visit [globalfishingwatch.org](http://globalfishingwatch.org) or the [official Global Fishing Watch blog](http://blog.globalfishingwatch.org).

One of our goals is to be as transparent as possible and release as much of our data as we can. To that end, we hope to be releasing datasets and analyses that are still "in development." We encourage you to provide feedback and make suggestions. If you have comments or questions, send an email to research@globalfishingwatch.org.
