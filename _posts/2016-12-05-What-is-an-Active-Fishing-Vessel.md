title: What is an 'Active' Fishing Vessel?

For the first release of our vessel lists -- [version 0.1](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/treniformis/tree/0.1/) -- we included only vessels that had more than 1000 positions in a given year, and we included only vessels that broadcast that they were fishing vessels 100 percent of the time in their identity messages.

However, many vessels have fewer than 1000 position messages in a year, and some vessels only broadcast that they are fishing vessels 90 percent of the time. Should we include these vessels in analyses and visualizations?

(More here soon)
