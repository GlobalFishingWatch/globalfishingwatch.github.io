# Fishing Activity

We are working to publish daily fishing activity by flag state and gear type. This data will be available for download by late 2017 or early 2018. If you would like to access a developmental version of this dataset, contact [research@globalfishingwatch.org](mailto:research@globalfishingwatch.org).

To learn more about how we identify fishing activity, visit the page for our [fishing algorithm]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/fishing.html).
