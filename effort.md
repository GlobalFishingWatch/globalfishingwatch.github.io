# Fishing Effort

Daily fishing effort, gridded at 0.01 degrees, by geartype and flag state, is available to download from [Global Fishing Watch's community page](https://globalfishingwatch.force.com/gfw/s/data_download).

The methodology for these data are described in our _Science_ paper, ["Tracking the Global Footprint of Fisheries"]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/global-footprint-of-fisheries.html).

Fishing effort is available for the time period 2012 to 2016. We will eventually be releasing in an up-to-date streaming format. If you would like access to provisional 2017 or 2018 data, contact reasearch@globalfishingwatch.org. 

We offer two forms of the data:

 - [Daily Fishing Effort and Vessel Presence at 100th Degree Resolution by Flag State and GearType, 2012-2016](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/Global-Footprint-of-Fisheries/blob/master/data_documentation/fishing_effort.md)
 - [Daily Fishing Effort and at 10th Degree Resolution by MMSI, 2012-2016](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/Global-Footprint-of-Fisheries/blob/master/data_documentation/fishing_effort_byvessel.md)

To read about recommended ways to use these data, as well as caveats on AIS coverage and usage, see our [page for Tracking the Global Footprint of Fisheries]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/global-footrpint-of-fisheries.html).
