# Transshipment Data

We are developing a dataset of likely and potential transshipments -- events where a fishing vessel meets up with a refrigerated cargo vessel to offload their catch while at sea.

To obtain our initial data on transshipment, visit [this link]() and register on globalfishingwatch.org.

We have also recently published a report on transshipment, which you can [download here]().
