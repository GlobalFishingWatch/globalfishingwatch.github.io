# Transshipment Data

We have developed a dataset of likely and potential transshipments -- events where a fishing vessel meets up with a refrigerated cargo vessel to offload their catch while at sea.

To obtain our initial data on transshipment, visit [this link](http://globalfishingwatch.org/data) and register on globalfishingwatch.org. We also published a report describing the methodology from the dataset, which you can [download here](http://globalfishingwatch.org/data).
