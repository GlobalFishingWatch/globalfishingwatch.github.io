# Transshipment Data

We are developing a dataset of likely transshipments -- events where a fishing vessel meets up with a refrigerated cargo vessel to offload their catch while at sea. 

We will be publishing some of our findings on this page in the near future. Below is a preliminary map showing where some transshipments may be taking place.
