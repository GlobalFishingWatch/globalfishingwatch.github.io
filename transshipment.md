# Transshipment Data

We have developed a dataset of likely and potential transshipments -- events where a fishing vessel meets up with a refrigerated cargo vessel to offload its catch while at sea. This data is available for 2012 to 2016, and we are working on a dataset that will be released in semi-real time.
