# Other Data

Global Fishing Watch will soon be sharing the following datasets. 
 
## Distance to Shore
This dataset provides, at one kilometer resolution, the distance from shore of every point in the ocean. We use this raster to calculate the distance from shore for every AIS position message in our database.

## Distance to Port
This dataset is the same as the distance to shore raster, but instead includes the distance to port. This dataset is still under development, largely because we are still developing our port database.

## Port Database
We are developing a port database based on where vessels with AIS anchor for longer than 48 hours. We plan to combine this data with the [World Port Index](http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&pubCode=0015)

## Anonymized AIS Data
The raw AIS data is commercial data owned by Orbcomm; we cannot make it freely available here. For testing purposes, and to test some of our AIS algorithms, we have created a sample dataset of anonymized AIS data. See our [Fishing Algorithm](fishing.html) page to learn more.
