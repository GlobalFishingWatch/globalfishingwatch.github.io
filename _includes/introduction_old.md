# Welcome to the Global Fishing Watchâ€™s public website for our data and open source code.

[Global Fishing Watch](http://globalfishingwatch.org){:target="_blank"} is a collaboration between [Oceana](http://oceana.org), [SkyTruth](http://SkyTruth.org), and [Google](https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html) to shine a light on all the practices of the fishing industry around the world. By using our public, [interactive map](http://map.globalfishingwatch.org){:target="_blank"} anyone with an internet connection can follow the movements of fishing vessels across the globe.

We at Global Fishing Watch are commited to making, as much as possible, our our data freely available and our code opensource. This website is your portal to this technology and data, and we will be updating it as more code and datasets are developed and publshed.

We are working to share the following: (Each of the following headings will link to a seperate page, and many/most of the sub pages will in turn link to github pages.)

## Processing AIS Data
 - link to benthos-pipeline (right?)

## Global Fishing Watch Interactive Map
 - Clustering and tileset generation
 - Visualization frontend 

## Fishing Algorithm
 - Link to repo and information on it
 - Labeled fishing effort, anonyomized
 - Map of confidence in fishing algorithm

## [Vessel Identity](vessels.html)
 - Likely fishing vessels
 - Vessel registries & matches with AIS data
 - Neural net (and then a link to the repo where this lives)

## [Fishing Effort](effort.html)
 - Daily rasters by flag state and geartype
 - Map of estimated coverage by flag state

## [Transshipment](transshipment.html)
 - Spreadsheet of possible meetups
 - Any other data we can share

## Other Data
 - Distance from shore raster
 - Ports database
 - Distance from port raster

Here's a chart Egil made:
