# Anonymized AIS Data

The raw AIS data we use is commercial data owned by Orbcomm. We cannot
make it freely available here. However, we have created a sample
dataset of labeled anonymized AIS data that can be
used to train fishing prediction models (ours or yours).

The anonymized training data is [available
here](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/training-data).
