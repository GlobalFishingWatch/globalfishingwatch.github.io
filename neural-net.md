# Neural Net Vessel Classifier

In addition to identifying vessels using information in the AIS data and matching this data to vessel registries (which comprise our [`known` and `likely` vessel lists]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/vessels.html)), we are using a convolutional neural network to identify the geartypes associated with different vessels.
